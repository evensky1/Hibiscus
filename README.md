#### It is necessary to implement an "Internet Banking" web application.  
The application should support:
<ol>
<li>Work from different browsers</li> 
<li>Enable user registration and authorization</li> 
<li>Simple, clear and beautiful user interface</li> 
<li>Create accounts</li> 
<li>Link cards to these accounts</li> 
<li>Display the current status of user accounts</li> 
<li>Display current exchange rates</li> 
<li>Make transfers to other users accounts</li> 
<li>Display completed transactions</li>
</ol>

It is necessary to implement work with databases and allow only authorized users to work.
The application must have high security, which requires the use of https connection and password
hashing in the database.
<br>
For better scalability, the application code should be subject to good writing practices,
with a proper delimitation into abstraction layers, as well as into server and client parts.
